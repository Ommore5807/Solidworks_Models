# Mechanical CAD Models Repository

This repository contains a collection of mechanical component and mechanism CAD models created for educational and design purposes. Each folder represents a different mechanical assembly or joint, modeled using industry-relevant tools like SolidWorks or Fusion 360.

## 📁 Folder Overview

### 🔩 Bench Vise
A standard bench vise model used in mechanical workshops for securing workpieces during operations like sawing or drilling. This assembly demonstrates sliding and clamping mechanisms.

### ✈️ Radial Engine
A simplified radial engine model showcasing the classic star-shaped cylinder arrangement. Ideal for understanding internal combustion engine motion and crankshaft dynamics.

### 🔧 Screw Joint
This folder contains a model demonstrating a screw-based fastening mechanism. It is useful for illustrating threaded motion and mechanical advantage in fasteners.

### 🪚 Step Bench
A compact, multi-functional step bench model commonly used in DIY or maintenance setups. Includes simple frame and load-bearing analysis references.

### 🔗 Universal Joint
A dynamic model of a universal joint (U-joint) used for transmitting torque between shafts at different angles. Helps visualize angular velocity variations and rotational freedom.

### 🛠️ Bench Vice (alternate model)
An alternative bench vise design with variations in clamping geometry and screw threading. Can be used
